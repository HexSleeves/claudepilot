# Product Requirements Document: Claude Session Manager TUI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a command-line tool that provides a Text-based User Interface (TUI) for managing multiple Claude sessions. The tool will allow users to spawn, monitor, and interact with multiple Claude instances simultaneously, facilitating complex workflows and interactions between them.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a user-friendly TUI for managing multiple Claude sessions.
*   To enable users to spawn new Claude sessions with specific prompts.
*   To allow users to monitor the status and output of each Claude session.
*   To facilitate interaction and data exchange between different Claude sessions.
*   To provide controls for starting, stopping, and managing the lifecycle of Claude sessions.

## 3. Features

### 3.1. Session Management

*   **Spawn New Sessions:** Users can create a new Claude session with a specific initial prompt.
*   **List Sessions:** The TUI will display a list of all active Claude sessions, showing their status (e.g., running, stopped), and a summary of their current task.
*   **Stop Sessions:** Users can terminate any running Claude session.
*   **View Session Details:** Users can select a session to view its full output and history.

### 3.2. Interaction

*   **Session-to-Session Communication:** Users can direct the output of one Claude session as input to another, enabling them to work together on a task.
*   **User-to-Session Interaction:** Users can send input or prompts to any active Claude session.

### 3.3. Monitoring

*   **Real-time Updates:** The TUI will update in real-time to show the latest output and status of each session.
*   **Log Viewer:** A dedicated view for each session's complete log history.

## 4. User Interface (UI)

The TUI will be divided into several panes:

*   **Session List Pane:** A list of all Claude sessions, showing their ID, status, and a brief description.
*   **Session Output Pane:** Displays the output of the currently selected session.
*   **Input Pane:** A command-line input for users to interact with the selected session or the TUI itself.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The TUI should be responsive and handle multiple sessions without significant lag.
*   **Reliability:** The tool should be stable and handle errors gracefully.
*   **Usability:** The TUI should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users familiar with command-line interfaces.

## 6. Future Considerations

*   **Session Snapshots:** Ability to save and load the state of all sessions.
*   **Scripting:** Allow users to script interactions between sessions for automating complex workflows.
*   **Plugin System:** Enable users to extend the functionality of the tool with custom plugins.
